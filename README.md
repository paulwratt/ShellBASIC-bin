# ShellBASIC-bin
Capitalised BASIC commmands wriiten in posix compatible shell scripts, suitible for use in shell environments, scripts and as extensions to BAS v2.4+ 

# usage
Place these in a folder in your **$PATH**. I put them in **~/bin** (users home directory) for development purposes and link them all to **/BASIC** which is in my **$PATH**. They are eventually intended to be a standalone shell environment, hence **/BASIC** which has read and execute privaledges for all users. They come with some folders, including **/BASIC/HELP** too.

Some scripts may only work as expected in interactive mode in a shell.

# why
A simple way to extend **BAS-2.5** via the _SHELL_ statement, and to proto-type extensions, like MSX-BASIC PSET & PRESET, APPLESOFT BASIC HCOLOR & HPLOT, Amstrad Locomotive BASIC PEN, PAPER & PLOT. To be further developed into C/C++ programs that do the same (mostly for speed and lower resource usage), or absorbed into **BAS-2.5-pw** when the infrastructure supports them (graphics, sound, etc).
